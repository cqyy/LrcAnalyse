What Makes It To - G.E.M. 邓紫棋 Everytime you walk away You take my smile away But I have no reason to make you stay Every promise you have made There's nothing could replace I hesitate if you were the right one who came late I try to mend I feel so ashamed You shouldn't be inside my mind But I'm so confused I always think of you What it makes to miss you so He's the one I should have hold But I can't block you out of my soul I don't wanna let you go What it makes to miss you so When you're gone I couldn't find my rainbow But I can't leave him alone in sorrow I have to let you go Every little thing you say and everything we taste They are something could never be erased Everything you dedicate There's nothing could replace I hesitate if you were the right one who came late I try to mend I feel so ashamed You shouldn't be inside my mind But I'm so confused I always think of you What it makes to miss you so He's the one I shouldn't have hold But I can't block you out of my soul I don't wanna let you go What it makes to miss you so When you're gone I couldn't find my rainbow But I can't leave him alone in sorrow I have to let you go If he didn't ever came into my life then I'll take no regret But I don't dare he'll be so sad Miss you so He's the one I should have hold I can't block you out of my soul I don't wanna let you go Miss you so When you're gone I couldn't find my rainbow But I can't leave him alone in sorrow I have to let you go
